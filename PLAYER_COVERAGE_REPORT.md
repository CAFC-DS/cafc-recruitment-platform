## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### **Backend API Endpoint:**

    sr.SCOUTING_TYPE,
    COUNT(DISTINCT sr.PLAYER_ID) as players_covered,
    COUNT(sr.ID) as total_reports
FROM matches m
INNER JOIN scout_reports sr ON m.ID = sr.MATCH_ID
WHERE sr.SCOUTING_TYPE = 'Live'  -- For LIVE analysis
GROUP BY m.ID, sr.SCOUTING_TYPE
```
